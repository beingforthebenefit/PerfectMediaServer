# PerfectMediaServer
Designing a perfect (pretty okay) media server

# Install
Run docker-compose up
Configure each application
Find the container names/ports with `docker ps`.

# Configuration
Each application has a lot of configurations to customize. (Perfect Media Server)[https://perfectmediaserver.com/] may help with configuring some of these modules, although I do no use many suggestions and use a lot of images which they do not.
